### Hi there,I'm Asif Tandel ðŸ‘‹
- I am currently working on Machine Learning,Deep Learning Use-Cases.

- Build an end-to-end data science pipelines from data-validation to model deployment in an fully automated approach that has helped in reducing 20-40% tasks.

- I am currently learning Computer Vision 

Project:-

1)Wafer Fault Detection-The inputs of various sensors for different wafers have been provided. In electronics, a wafer (also called a slice or substrate) is a thin slice of semiconductor used for the fabrication of integrated circuits. The goal is to build a machine learning model which predicts whether a wafer needs to be replaced or not(i.e., whether it is working or not) based on the inputs from various sensors. There are two classes: +1 and -1. 

â€¢	+1 means that the wafer is in a working condition and it doesnâ€™t need to be replaced.

â€¢	-1 means that the wafer is faulty and it needs to be replaced.

2)Cement Strength Prediction:-To build a regression model to predict the concrete compressive strength based on the different features in the training data.
