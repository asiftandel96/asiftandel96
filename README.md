### Hi there,I'm Asif Tandel 👋

- :blush:I am currently working on Machine Learning,Deep Learning Use-Cases

- I am addicted to learning and growing every day

- I am currently learning Computer Vision,Image Classification,Object Detection etc.

- Build an end-to-end data science pipelines from data-validation to model deployment in an fully automated approach that has helped in reducing 20-40% tasks.



Project:-:ballot_box_with_check:

:ballot_box_with_check:Wafer Fault Detection-The inputs of various sensors for different wafers have been provided. In electronics, a wafer (also called a slice or substrate) is a thin slice of semiconductor used for the fabrication of integrated circuits. The goal is to build a machine learning model which predicts whether a wafer needs to be replaced or not(i.e., whether it is working or not) based on the inputs from various sensors. There are two classes: +1 and -1. 

•	+1 means that the wafer is in a working condition and it doesn’t need to be replaced.

•	-1 means that the wafer is faulty and it needs to be replaced.
